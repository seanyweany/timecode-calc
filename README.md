Okay, truthfully, I just wanted to try out Anthropics Opus 4.6 by asking it to write this<br>
What do you think? I thought it was impressive...

### Usage
So far, it just calculates the difference between two timecodes @ 30fps.<br>
``tccalc [hh;mm;ss;ff] [hh;mm;ss;ff]``<br>
(e.g., ``tccalc 42;11 29;09`` prints ``13;02``, even ``tccalc 2;14;59;03 33;19`` prints ``02;14;25;14``)
